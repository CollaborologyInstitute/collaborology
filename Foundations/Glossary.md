## Introduction and History

- Terminology documented here likely came from earlier efforts to compile a glossary for Distributed Knowledge Repository v2 Project, and was kept at [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W5ln6KTGh6XLQUd9HPpgzp8keCdI4Prqv9m4dDPjzK8/edit?usp=sharing). DKR was a term created by [Douglas Carl Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart), which I have adopted.
- Another glossary was attempted for the [Global Challenges Collaboration](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GlobalChallengesCollaboration) proposal submitters (Tammy Lea Meyer \[[medium](https://medium.com/@tammyleameyer), [wisdom factory](https://thewisdomfactory.net/tammy-lea-meyer/), [facebok](https://www.facebook.com/tammy.l.meyer.7/)\] and [Sam Hahn](https://SuperSammetry.com/about/) aka "SH"), and was kept at this [other Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G3xrZz-YA7J093x6F9bPvv1R5Fee-T0_93cFF4TJ89Q/edit?usp=sharing).
- This document is intended to eventually deprecate those other glossaries, as it is now on a standard platform that is widely recognized to enable and encourage distributed collaboration.
